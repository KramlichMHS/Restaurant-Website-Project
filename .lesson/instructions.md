# Restaurant Website Project

**Directions:** You will create a website for your own restaurant. Before you begin creating your website, you research what type of restaurant you would like to create and make a site map. Things to include on your site map: **Home page, menu(with at least 8 dishes), Contact Us, and to-go order form**. You can use google drawings to complete your map. See the example sitemap below the rubric. Your site map **must** be added to your files in repl as it will be a part of the rubric.

Your website must contain at least the 4 pages listed above. Your site must also include the use of a Form (Bootstrap of normal CSS). **Your to-go order form should contain enough information for a customer to successfully place an order for pick up at a specified time.** Other forms of CSS and Bootstrap usage including animations, transitions, glyphicons, page-headers, buttons, containers, tables and hover/active selectors will be needed to create a Professional Level website.
